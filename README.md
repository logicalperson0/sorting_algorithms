Sorting algorithms

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX.

It aims to learn about sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and so on) 
and Big O Notation in C language.

The files:

0-bubble_sort.c: Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm  
0-O: File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm

1-insertion_sort_list.c: Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the
Insertion sort algorithm
1-O: File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm

2-selection_sort.c: Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
2-O: File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm

3-quick_sort.c: Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
3-O: File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm

100-shell_sort.c: Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm
